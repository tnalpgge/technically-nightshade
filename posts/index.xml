I use it under protest and under duress. It&amp;rsquo;s important software to a lot of people, but it feels like dragging a steamer trunk crammed full of clothes and equipment to the corner store at the end of the block when you just want a quick snack. So I look for alternatives in free, libre, and open-source software that are compatible with revision control systems for text files; they can run quite well on older and lower-spec machines.</description></item><item><title>Generating Royal History</title><link>https://tnalpgge.github.io/technically-nightshade/posts/generating-royal-history/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tnalpgge.github.io/technically-nightshade/posts/generating-royal-history/</guid><description>Recently I found myself in a bit of a bind as someone who wants to write homebrew content for a very popular tabletop role-playing game.
