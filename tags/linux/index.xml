My co-workers know me as a person who likes command lines, and whose definition of a &amp;ldquo;one-liner&amp;rdquo; may be a bit&amp;hellip;expansive at times. The challenge for me, therefore, is to replicate the results in a slightly different environment, with fewer frills, with fewer graphical installs, and more typing.</description></item><item><title>Multiple Personality ZFS Part 2: The Export/Import Business</title><link>https://tnalpgge.github.io/technically-nightshade/posts/mpzfs-2-export-import-business/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tnalpgge.github.io/technically-nightshade/posts/mpzfs-2-export-import-business/</guid><description>I have spread story of this journey across a series of posts:
